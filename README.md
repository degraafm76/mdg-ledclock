# Printing parts
The parts are designed with PLA in mind. Nozzle width must be 0.4mm and layer hight 0.2mm. For the front ring and case supports on build plate are needed.

The front ring must be printed in muliple colors. The first 3 layers white and the rest of the layers black. If you don't know how to print multicolor objects with your printer I suggest you take a look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nBnVtOEAiY
